A Complex Oscillator for the Daisy Seed DSP platform, inspired by the Buchla 259.

This is a robust complex oscillator that provides an amazing range of sonic vistas through a Modulator that can affect the Primary Oscillator's frequency, sync, amplitude and wavefolding.  

## Features  

### USB-MIDI Control  

The instrument is recognized as a USB-MIDI device, allowing control of the oscillators' frequencies by MIDI note data.

## Common Oscillator Controls  

Both the Modulator and Primary Oscillators share the following features:  

- **Coarse Pitch Knob** - adjusts the frequency of the oscillator by +/- 2 octaves
- **Fine Pitch Knob** - adjusts the frequency of the oscillator by +/- 2 semitones  

### Modulator Oscillator  

- **MIDI Control** - the Modulator accepts MIDI data on any MIDI channel except 2 when the Range Switch is not in LFO mode.  
- **Range Switch** - switches between audio-rate mode and LFO mode.  LFO mode rate ranges from 0.05 - 20Hz and incoming MIDI data is ignored.  
- **Wave Select Switch** - switches the Modulator Oscillator's waveform between sine and triangle waveforms
- **Frequency Mod Knob** - adjusts the amount of modulation of the frequency of the Primary Oscillator
- **Amp Mod Knob** - adjusts the amount of modulation of the amplifier
- **Timbre Mode Knob** - adjusts the amount of modulation of the wavefolder  

### Primary Oscillator  

- **MIDI Control** - the Modulator accepts MIDI data on channel 2  
- **Wave Select Switch** - switches the Primary Oscillator's waveform between triangle-like and square-like waveforms
- **Waveshape Knob** - changes the shape of the waveform between Saw / Triangle / Ramp when the Primary Oscillator's Wave Select Switch is set to triangle, or changes the pulse width of the squarewave when the Wave Select Switch is set to square.  
- **Sync Switch** - hard syncs the Primary Oscillator to the Modulator Oscillator when enabled  
- **Chaos Knob** - frequency modulates the Modulator by the Primary output- guaranteed to get weird!  

### Wavefolder   

- **Timbre Knob** - adjusts the amount of wavefolding applied to the output of the Primary Oscillator  
- **Symmetry Knob** - adjusts the offset of Primary Oscillator before it is sent into the wavefolder  

## Current Status of Project  

All basic features are implemented except for implementing the planned Harmonics Knob in he wavefolder and adding CV inputs and their related attenuators/attenuverters.  These will require some hardware that I don't have on hand yet to translate Eurorack-level control voltages to the range used by the Daisy Seed.  

## Issues and foibles  

The planned Harmonics Knob will require some math skills that I don't have yet, and is thus not yet implemented.  

Eurorack-compatible CV input is planned:  including 1 volt/octave and a secondary frequency control for each oscillator, CV inputs for frequency mod, amp mod, timbre mod, and shape mod with appropriate attenuators/attenuverters, and an external Sync input.  

The Daisy gets overloaded when the Modulator is in LFO mode and it is turned down to a low rate and this is used to modulate the Timbre.  I probably need to change the waveform from a polyblep to a regular triangle when it's in LFO mode. 

Wavefolding a squarewave is stupid sounding.  Either change the waveforms available in the square output mode to include a sine wave or maybe when the wavefolder is enabled at all the primary OSC doesn't output a squar wave but something else (sine?) instead.  

If the Harmonics Knob is difficult to implement, it would great to add Amp controls to the Timbre section instead (or maybe both features if they'll fit).
